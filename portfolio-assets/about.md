# About
I'm a junior developer who enjoys building things that live on the internet.
I'm a self-motivated learner who can work independently and collaboratively in a team.
I love working on fun projects and keeping up with the programming world that is growing **blazingly fast**.
I also love open-source, UI design, and orange cats :)
